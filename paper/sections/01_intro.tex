%importance of good fiscal policy
There are two main form of policy used to regulate the US economy: monetary and fiscal.  The central bank exercises power over the aggregate money supply to change interest rates in an effort to impact consumption decisions.  The federal government affects the economy through the two main mechanisms of public spending and taxation.  

Prolonged budget deficits can have significant negative effects on long-run economic outcomes through reduced national savings and higher interest rates \parencite{gale2003economic}. 

%how the multiplier factors into this

Competing theories of the effect of fiscal policy on output exist.  While the general IS-LM model predicts an increase in government spending to have an expansionary effect on output, standard real business cycle (RBC) models predict the opposite depending on assumptions of Ricardian versus non-Ricardian consumers \parencite{gali2007understanding}.


%some data/graphs??


%This paper explores.... we find....
This paper explores a method of estimation for the fiscal multipilier for the United States economy using structural vector autoregression (SVAR).  Using federal reserve data from 1960-2007 we find a negligible effect of government expenditure on GDP robust to several specifications.
