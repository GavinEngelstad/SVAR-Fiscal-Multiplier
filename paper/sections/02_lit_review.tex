Previous studies suggest underestimation of the multiplier led to misestimation of growth during financial crises \parencite{blanchard2013growth}.  

Increasing taxes reduces GDP \parencite{barro2011macroeconomic}

Multiplier estimated through
\begin{itemize}
    \item using one through seven quarter ahead forecasts of key macroeconomic variables such as consumption, output, and wages to control for agents' information sets \parencite{hall2023economic}
\end{itemize}


Estimate of multiplier depends heavily on method of estimation \parencite{gechert2012fiscal}.
